<h2>Sneaker Culture Conquered The World</h2> <div class=\"descriptions\"> <div class=\"left\"> <p>They wait in long lines in the bitter cold. They squeal with delight over the stitch on the shoes or the faux snakeskin upper. Colors more likely to be seen during Carnival in Rio than on any self-conscious American are hits. Catty quips about style choices are met with irrational exuberance over over-hyped new designs.</p> <p>No, these aren’t the insufferable Carrie wannabes taking up New York’s sidewalks—they are teenage boys and grown men all over the world going on about basketball sneakers.</p> <p>In terms of American contributions to global style and comfort, the basketball sneaker has to rank up there with the T-shirt and riveted jeans. And as can be seen in any mall or casual glance around the subway, the sneakers left the court long ago.</p> <p>Today, sneakers are a hugely lucrative juggernaut. In 2012, for instance, Nike’s line of LeBron James sneakers generated $300 million—in the U.S alone. Apparently everybody still wants to be like Mike—so much so that kids get shot over pairs of his namesake sneakers. And the footwear’s infiltration of the fashion world is pretty much complete.</p> </div> <div class=\"right\"> <p>In his new book Slam Kicks: Basketball Sneakers that Changed the Game, published by Rizzoli this week, Slam Magazine editor Ben Osborne sketches the vivid and passion-filled history of the sneaker. Osborne takes us back to 1917 and the Converse Rubber Shoe Company in Massachusetts, and the company’s iconic hi-top All Stars.</p> <p>With the All Stars, Osborne also introduces the two significant themes that underpin not only his book, but the wearing of basketball sneakers to the present day.</p> <p>The first is the move to assign the naming of shoes to a specific, recognizable person. In this earliest case it was Chuck Taylor in 1921, four years after the shoes were released, who played for the brand’s semi-pro All Star team. Taylor offered his two cents for some changes to the shoe, and in turn Converse named the shoes for him, and placed his now iconic signature on the side.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"bottom-links\"> <span>James O'Connor</span> <a href=\"#\" class=\"link\">Read More</a> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"right-showcase\"></div> </div> </div> </section> <section class=\"articles\"> <div class=\"articles__container\"> <div class=\"articles__container__box\"> <div class=\"left-content\"> <div class=\"left-author\"> <span class=\"num\">.02</span> </div> <div class=\"right-content\"> <h2>Shoes: A fashion statement for all</h2> <div class=\"descriptions\"> <div class=\"left\"> <p>In today's fashion world shoes have to be more versatile than ever. Unless you stay home all the time, it's likely that you have to wear shoes of some sort every day. The designers of the fashion world have responded with shoes for every occasion; even for those that don't like to wear shoes.</p> <p>In the world of business shoes that won't blister your feet are very important. Many women that walk any distance bring tennis shoes for the walk and change into dress shoes once they arrive at their place of employment. When they do make that change, it's not often that you'll see them change into any type of high heel. It's certainly not like it used to be when all women would be in the high heeled shoes. Today's business world will see women wearing lower and fatter heels in order to protect their feet.</p> <p>In terms of American contributions to global style and comfort, the basketball sneaker has to rank up there with the T-shirt and riveted jeans. And as can be seen in any mall or casual glance around the subway, the sneakers left the court long ago.</p> <p>If attending an event such as a wedding or other banquet type party, the high heeled shoes make a grand return. Most women will wear them to complement their dresses. They will either match or contrast with the dress that they have chosen to wear.</p> </div> <div class=\"right\"> <p>In complete contrast boots of all sizes make a statement during the cold winter months. Boots that are tall can be worn with mid-length skirts to show off the style of the boot. Recently those that prefer cowboy boots are beginning to wear their jeans inside the boots. Again, this shows off the style of the boot.</p> <p>Short boots can also make a statement. A shorter boot can be worn with a longer skirt. This combination can make a stylish statement just as much as the opposite. Shorter boots can be worn with slacks in the business place. Those that work in the city and choose to switch between tennis shoes and boots will have an easier time switching with short boots rather than long boots.</p> <p>Shoes are the defining piece that creates a style. They make a statement and add function to fashion. They can make your feet feel like their floating in the clouds or they can put a punch line on a flashy number. Style is defined by every piece of the outfit including the shoes.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"bottom-links\"> <span>Mary Jones</span> <a href=\"#\" class=\"link\">Read More</a> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"right-showcase-two\"></div> </div> </div> </section> <section class=\"articles\"> <div class=\"articles__container\"> <div class=\"articles__container__box\"> <div class=\"left-content\"> <div class=\"left-author\"> <span class=\"num\">.03</span> </div> <div class=\"right-content\"> <h2>Your shoes are made of plastic</h2> <div class=\"descriptions\"> <div class=\"left\"> <p>The shoe that changed everything, according to designer D’Wayne Edwards, was the Nike Air Max 1.</p> <p>It was like nothing the young Edwards had ever seen. The designer, Nike’s Tinker Hatfield, had been an architect before he became a shoe designer, and he modeled his 1987 Air Max 1 after a famous building: Paris’s Pompidou Center, which wore its piping and structure on the outside of the building, rather than hidden inside.</p> <p>Hatfield used the same principles for the shoe to highlight a new, special technology: a puffy inflatable bladder filled with air that sat under the wearer’s heel. In the never-ending quest to build the best, lightest, strongest shoe for the athletes who were pushing the limits of human performance, the bladder was Nike’s way to soften the pressure of a hard landing on a basketball court, and was also a way to save weight, because what could be lighter than air?</p> <p>“As a design, it was so new and cool,” says Edwards. And, he says, it symbolized something meaningful in the history of shoe design: “This could only happen,” he says, “because of plastic.”</p> </div> <div class=\"right\"> <p>Worldwide, more than 24 billion pairs of shoes were made in 2018, with over two billion pairs sold in the U.S. alone. That’s more than seven pairs per person each year filling up American’s closets, piling up near doorways, and eventually making their way to the trash.</p> <p>Most of those shoes are partly, or in many cases completely, fabricated from plastic and plastic-like materials, from the squishy soles to the pointy heels to the knit polyester uppers to the brittle eyelet holes. Because of their construction—usually, their many components are stitched and glued and molded together in complicated ways—they’re almost impossible to recycle. So your feet are only a short stopover in their long, long lifetimes, before they pile up in landfills and float down waterways, often living on like zombies for hundreds of years.</p> <p>The first stirrings of a shoe revolution are fomenting, though, and the industry is starting to look hard at the ways it can build a better, more sustainable mousetrap for your feet. But to understand how big of a challenge that is, we have to understand how we ended up in a world where most shoes are a soft, squishy mess of plastics.</p> <p>Until the middle of the 1800s, shoes were made from materials found in the natural world. Wood for heels. Tanned leathers for uppers and straps. Soles were rubber, or cork, or sometimes hunks of wood carved to cradle a foot. But shifting culture and materials science were coming for shoes, as they came for everything else.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"bottom-links\"> <span>Alexandar Baruda</span> <a href=\"#\" class=\"link\">Read More</a> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"right-showcase-three\"></div> </div> </div> </section> <section class=\"articles\"> <div class=\"articles__container\"> <div class=\"articles__container__box\"> <div class=\"left-content\"> <div class=\"left-author\"> <span class=\"num\">.04</span> </div> <div class=\"right-content\"> <h2>The history of sneakers</h2> <div class=\"descriptions\"> <div class=\"left\"> <p>The global sneaker market valued at approximately US$79 billion (£56 billion) in 2020 and is predicted to reach US$120 billion (£85 billion) by 2026. With such huge growth, it is unsurprising that they are considered big business.</p> <p>Such are the strides in the sneaker industry that a new exhibition at London’s Design Museum explores how the shoe became an undisputed cultural symbol of our times.</p> <p>The last decade has seen a huge shift in how sneakers are worn. Donning a pair is no longer frowned upon in the workplace or on more formal occasions. Even British etiquette experts Debrett’s have given their seal of approval, deeming them socially acceptable for smart casual occasions.</p> <p>The continued dominance of the athleisure trend has had a significant impact on the growing sales of sneakers – along with the pursuit of comfort. This only grew more during the pandemic as lockdowns made people further prioritise comfort, which resulted in a rise in sales of loungewear, athleisure and flat shoes, like sneakers.</p> </div> <div class=\"right\"> <p>As such, sneakers have moved from the niche to become coveted as fashionable objects. Footwear is now the biggest selling category in the online luxury market and sneakers have made a significant contribution to this growth.</p> <p>High fashion brands from Gucci to Balenciaga are setting the pace in the luxury sneaker market. In 2017, Balenciaga’s Triple S became the biggest seller in the luxury sneaker market and its popularity seems unstoppable.</p> <p>To understand how the sneaker has emerged to become a footwear phenomenon, it is important to trace its legacy from function to cultural icon.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"bottom-links\"> <span>Adam Pillay</span> <a href=\"#\" class=\"link\">Read More</a> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"right-showcase-four\"></div> </div> </div> </section> </main> <footer class=\"footer\"> <div class=\"footer__grid\"> <div class=\"community\"> <span>JOIN THE COMMUNITY</span> <h2>WHAT DO YOU RUN FOR ?</h2> </div> <div class=\"showcase-one\"></div> <div class=\"showcase-two\"></div> <div class=\"box-one\"> <p>Sign up for exclusive first fan loyalty perks and a sneak peek at our upcoming joint adventure.</p> <div class=\"social\"> <a href=\"#\"><i class=\"fa-facebook-f fab\"></i></a> <a href=\"#\"><i class=\"fa-instagram fab\"></i></a> </div> </div> <div class=\"box-two\"> <form action=\"\"> <input type=\"text\" required placeholder=\"Email...\"> <button type=\"submit\">Subscribe</button> </form> </div> <div class=\"box-three\"> <a href=\"#\">Questions & Answers</a> <a href=\"#\">Where to buy</a> <a href=\"#\">Performance & Stability</a> <a href=\"#\">Contact Us</a> </div> <div class=\"bottom-left\"> <a href=\"#\">Warranty</a> <a href=\"#\">Refund & Return Policy</a> <a href=\"#\">Shipping Policy</a> <a href=\"#\">Terms of Service</a> <a href=\"#\">Privacy Policy</a> </div> <div class=\"bottom-right\"> <a href=\"#\">&copy; Swift 2021</a> </div> </div> </footer> </div>  <script src=\"/d3718323f5368f6c1639467fb15c81bb.js\"></script> <script src=\"/42f69825340f0b5fa628d80900a46daa.js\"></script> </body></html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"3bd22b37494bd83985da0bbde626bd68","cacheData":{}}
