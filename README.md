# Swift: High-endurance outdoor shoes

Swift is a client-side online store that contains High-endurance shoes for the harshest outdoor conditions. This sites main focus is making a modern looking online store that has decent UI/UX . The website combines both a client-side functional shopping cart where a user can add /  remove products. For this I used a commerce tool that enables you to upload products in JSON format and show on your website. They have pre-built templates and a custom approach which I chose with Javascript. Overall I loved creating this site and It made me focus on different factors of the development/design process.
